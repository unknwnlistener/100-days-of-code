# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Forked 100-days-of-code repo. Tweeted out commitment yesterday.

**Thoughts:** Hyped about starting. Worried I might quit halfway. But if you never start then you can never progress so diving right into it

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started on the 'Build a Tribute Page' zipline by FreeCodeCamp. Required working in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** Made some progress so I'm not too upset about it. Have been stuck on this project for a year now cause I'm emotionally attached to it. 
Still not happy with what I've made but it's a start! Will revisit this in the future.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started Portfolio Page for FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Busy day today so nearly tried to skip a day. But decided against it and did a little, even if it was just starting a codepen page. Hopefully get more work done tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued work on the Portfolio Page for FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Busy for 3 days and realising that I'll keep getting busier. Need to schedule better to find time for 100 Days of Code.
